# Risk_Analytics
Develop a model which adopt risk analytics solutions that can provide real time insights for Banks and Financial Institutions.

This has two different kinds of scenarios:
The client experiencing payment difficulties: He/she was more than X days overdue on at least one of the loan's first Y payments in our sample,
All other situations: Every situation in which the payment is made on time.
There are four possible decisions that a client or corporation could make in response to a loan application:
The Company has accepted the loan application.
Cancelled: During the approval process, the client cancelled the application. Either the customer changed his or her mind about the loan, or in some circumstances since the customer posed a greater risk, the pricing was worse than the customer wanted.
Rejected: The loan was turned down by the business (because the client didn't comply with their conditions, etc.).
Unused offer: The client cancelled the loan at various points during the application procedure.
